### First IT job 

Could you describe your role in your first IT Company? 

Sure. I started my first job in 2015. Back then I started to work in a small company, I can say that it was a successful startup, which performs on the financial market. The company name was Turbine Analytics. It offered a solution for institutions called in Poland's financial houses, (those institutions had the right to manage financial papers in the name of individual investors. The software which was prepared in this company shows the current state of financial assets, like f.e. bonds, some company shares, etc. Turbine Analytics provided two kinds of software one which enables one to account for this kind of assets, and the second one which should give the same possibilities as the first one but with new features like allowing making some financial operations through this software.
